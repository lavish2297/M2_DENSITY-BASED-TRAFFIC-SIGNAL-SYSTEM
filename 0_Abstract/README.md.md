DENSITY BASED TRAFFIC SIGNAL SYSTEM

The project is creating a density-based dynamic traffic signal system, in which the timing of the signal changes automatically in response to the density of traffic at any given intersection. In most cities throughout the world, traffic congestion is a major issue, and as a result,It's time to move away from manual mode or fixed timer mode and toward an automated system with decision-making capabilities.capabilities. The current traffic signalling system is based on a fixed time schedule, which may cause delays.If one lane is open while the others are closed, it is inefficient
